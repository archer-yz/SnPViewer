# Contributing to SnPViewer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SnPViewer! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SnPViewer.git
   cd SnPViewer
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**

   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended)
   uv sync

   # Or using pip
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   uv run pytest  # Run tests
   uv run python -m frontend.app  # Run application
   ```

## üß™ Development Workflow

### Code Quality Standards

We maintain high code quality standards:

```bash
# Linting and formatting
uv run ruff check .    # Check for issues
uv run ruff format .   # Auto-format code

# Testing
uv run pytest                    # Run all tests
uv run pytest --cov=backend     # With coverage
uv run pytest -v tests/specific_test.py  # Specific tests
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- **Follow PEP 8**: Use ruff for automated formatting
- **Type Hints**: All functions should have type annotations
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions
- **Import Order**: Follow isort conventions (handled by ruff)

Example function:

```python
def parse_frequency(value: str) -> float:
    """Parse frequency string with suffix support.

    Args:
        value: Frequency string (e.g., "2.4G", "1e9", "900M")

    Returns:
        Frequency value in Hz

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the frequency string is invalid
    """
    # Implementation here
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Frontend Structure

- **widgets/**: Custom Qt widgets and UI components
- **dialogs/**: Property dialogs and user interactions
- **services/**: Background services and utilities
- **app.py**: Main application window and coordination

### Backend Structure

- **models/**: Data structures (Dataset, Chart, Project, etc.)
- **parsing/**: Touchstone file parsing and conversion
- **services/**: Business logic and data processing

### Key Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: UI logic separate from business logic
- **Signal-Slot Architecture**: Qt-based event handling
- **Model-View Pattern**: Clean data and presentation separation
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints throughout
